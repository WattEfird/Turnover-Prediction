# Turnover-Prediction


The goal of this problem is to predict the Annual Turnover of a restaurant based on the variables provided in the data set. <br>

Metric to measure<br>
The measure of accuracy will be RMSE (Root mean square error)<br>

The predicted Annual Turnover for each restaurant in the Test dataset will be compared with the actual Annual Turnover to calculate the RMSE value of the entire prediction.<br>
The lower the RMSE value, the better the model will be.
